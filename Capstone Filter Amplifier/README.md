# Filter Design 

For my Senior Year Design project, we took on a project
for "Test Tank Automation for Beam Pattern Analysis." My 
primary role in the project was to create a filter amplifier
with the following specifications:

- Selectable gains from 24-60dB with 6dB of increment

- Selectable bandwidths of 40-90kHz, 150-250kHz, 250-350kHz and 350-500kHz

- Can amplify voltages as low as 10uV

- Can amplify a high impedance input voltage

- Can be powered off battery power for 48h

In this repository is the final schematic, the resulting frequency response 
across the desired frequencies and the document explaining the overall design.
